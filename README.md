## Overview

LaTex source code for a CV.

## Useage & Requirements

To compile the .tex code to PDF a LaTex environment is required.

Hence use a LaTex environment of choice.

I recommend for Ubuntu users: 
* TexMaker [TexMaker Installation Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.devmanuals.net/install/ubuntu/ubuntu-16-04-LTS-Xenial-Xerus/how-to-install-texmaker.html)

And ShareLatex is also good for running straight in the browser:

* [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/project)
